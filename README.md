Hey there! I’m a developer who’s really into backend development. I enjoy discovering new technologies and challenging myself to grow.

What I’m Working On:
📚 Learning MongoDB right now—I’m aiming to get really good at it.
🤖 Exploring Artificial Intelligence because I think it’s awesome to create things that can actually "think."
What I Love:
🚀 Building solid backend systems that just work.
🔍 Trying out new tools and tech to stay curious and up to date.
💡 Turning ideas into cool, working projects.
Feel free to reach out or collaborate if you’re into the same stuff. Let’s make something cool together! 😊
